        <p>MarketChange is a different kind of cryptocurrency. It wasn't created so it the owner who premined half of it could make a million and run. It was designed to be a simple but effective currency that would change how people buy products from merchants. With the decentralization of Bitcoin technology, and the ASIC-resistance that scrypt provides, MarketChange provides an easy way for merchants to accept cryptocurrency, without having to wait minutes or hours for the transaction to confirm. Like all cryptocurrency, it is open-source, and MarketChange has absolutely no pre-mine. So go on, <a href="download.html">download the client</a> and change the way you buy products, <b>with MarketChange.</b></p>
